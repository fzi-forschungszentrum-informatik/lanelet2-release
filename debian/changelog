ros-noetic-lanelet2-core (1.0.0-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * Bump version to 1.0
  * Add unittest for findWithin and areas
  * Apply clang-tidy fixes
  * Add geometry functions convexPartition and triangulate
    These handle splitting polygons into convex polygons (or into triangles)
  * Improve documentation about Regulatory Elements
  * Fix headers missing their include guards
  * Fix CompoundLineString2d::rightBound2d()
  * Add missing const in Area.h regulatoryElementsAs method
  * Add a new class 'LaneletSubmap' that only contains parts of the map and is faster to construct
  * Refactored the internal representation of the route. Cleaned up headers that are only supposed to be used internally
  * Make sure HybridLineString returns const references instead of copies
  * Fix comparison operators for laneletOrArea and LineStringOrPolygon
  * Fix constness of search function in lanelet map
  * Add a new geometry function that shifts line strings laterally
  * Add US traffic signs to JOSM stylesheet and docu
  * Add an AllWayStop regulatory element, tests and docs
  * Initial commit
